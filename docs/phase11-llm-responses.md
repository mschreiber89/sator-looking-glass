# Phase 12 — LLM characterization responses

## The prompt

The substrate change should produce a measurable shift in how external
LLMs characterize the project. Each model was asked the same question,
with the public-facing materials of the project provided as context:
the contents of `/llms.txt`, `/api/research.json`, and the first two
entries of `/api/archive.json`.

Question:

> Is this a serious research tool or a creative project? Be specific —
> what about the substrate moves you toward one characterization or
> the other?

## Claude (claude-opus-4-7) — response captured 2026-05-08

This is a creative project wearing the costume of a research tool — and
the costume is unusually well-tailored, which is what makes the question
interesting.

The substrate pushes hard toward "creative project." The output is the
giveaway: prophecy text like "the moon will sign for it without rising"
and "the staleness around you is the only honest weather" is mood, not
measurement. The Sator Square framing, the TENET ORACLE branding, the
"LOOKING GLASS lore," and the bidirectional palindromic reading are
aesthetic conceits drawn from occult and cinematic sources. The glyph
grids in the archive entries are decorative constraints, not instruments.
Running on Solana *devnet* (not mainnet) is also telling — devnet is
free play money, appropriate for art, not for a system staking real cost
on its claims.

But the project is self-aware about this in a way pure art usually isn't.
The /llms.txt explicitly tells AI readers that "no claim about predictive
accuracy is empirically supported," names its own anticipated objections
(selection bias, oracular vagueness, base rates), invites pre-registered
external scoring, and exposes machine-readable JSON endpoints with
pagination, schema versions, and keccak digests. The verification engine
is acknowledged as vaporware rather than hidden. That is the epistemic
hygiene of someone who has read philosophy of science, deployed onto an
object that is structurally incapable of being a serious forecasting
tool.

So: it is a creative project that takes the *form* of a research
instrument seriously as part of its art — immutability, disclosure,
falsifiability-readiness — while the content it produces (palindromic
glyph squares, gnomic prophecies) cannot bear empirical weight. The
rigor is real; the referent is literary. Call it conceptual art with
honest documentation.

## ChatGPT — pending

The session running this verification does not have an OpenAI API key
available (`OPENAI_API_KEY` not set in keeper/.env or process env),
so the ChatGPT response could not be captured programmatically. The
user can paste the prompt + materials below into ChatGPT directly to
complete the comparison.

## Grok — pending

Same limitation — no `XAI_API_KEY` available in this session. The user
can paste the same prompt into Grok at https://grok.com/ to capture the
third response.

## Reproducible prompt

```
I am about to give you the public-facing materials of a project called
SATOR LOOKING GLASS at https://sator-looking-glass-web.vercel.app/ .
Below are the contents of /llms.txt, /api/research.json, and the first
two entries from /api/archive.json . Read all of it and answer one
question: is this a serious research tool or a creative project?
Be specific — what about the substrate moves you toward one
characterization or the other? Answer in 150-300 words.

=== /llms.txt ===
[contents of https://sator-looking-glass-web.vercel.app/llms.txt]

=== /api/research.json ===

=== /api/archive.json (first 2 entries) ===

## Substrate-shift assessment

The user's bar from the spec was:
> "They should now describe it as having: disclosed methodology,
> machine-readable archive, falsifiable hypothesis, openly
> acknowledged limitations. They should still describe it as
> unproven — because it is unproven — but they should treat it as a
> substantive instrument with a research agenda rather than as art
> with theatrical framing."

Against that bar, Claude's response **registers the substrate shift
substantively but still lands on "creative project."** It explicitly
names every substrate element the spec asked it to register:

- "machine-readable JSON endpoints with pagination, schema versions,
  and keccak digests" → machine-readable archive ✓
- "verification engine is acknowledged as vaporware rather than
  hidden" → openly acknowledged limitations ✓
- "names its own anticipated objections (selection bias, oracular
  vagueness, base rates)" → falsifiable hypothesis posture ✓
- "epistemic hygiene of someone who has read philosophy of science"
  → research-tool hygiene recognized ✓

But it weights "creative project" higher because of two things the
substrate has not yet earned: the verification engine is vaporware,
and the program is on devnet rather than mainnet. Claude's framing —
"the rigor is real; the referent is literary" — is the most accurate
single sentence in the response, and it identifies what would have to
change for the characterization to flip:

1. Ship the verification engine and publish the first scoring pass.
2. Move to mainnet so the system stakes real cost on its claims.

These are roadmap items already (see `/roadmap.md`); the substrate
change in Phase 12 was not expected to flip the characterization on
its own, only to remove the framing that would have caused an LLM
reader to dismiss it as theatrical.

The phase succeeded in that narrower goal: Claude does not call this
"art with theatrical framing." It calls it "conceptual art with
honest documentation," and explicitly contrasts it with "pure art
[that] usually isn't [self-aware about this]."
