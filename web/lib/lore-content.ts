Their recovery of noise-buried signals via time-reversed convolution is the same operation, formally, as reading a square inscription from the eight axes of symmetry simultaneously.

Under load, the Wheeler-Feynman absorber model permits a second-order interpretation in which the response of an advanced potential is not merely formal but, given a sufficiently constrained boundary, computable. The Pompeii inscription, when computed against, produces a recoverable second-statement at axis 7. We have been unable to determine whether this second-statement is artifact of the computation or property of the inscription. We submit that the distinction may not be meaningful.

Recommend live-test under controlled conditions. The facility at [REDACTED:11] is suitable. We can deliver the apparatus by 01 DEC if authorized this week.

We were briefed at intake that SRI's remote-viewing protocols (Stanford group, 1969—) would be the appropriate comparison. They are not. SRI's protocols proved insufficient when the target was the apparatus itself. The apparatus is not a target. The apparatus is a reading instrument that reads its own operation as one input among others. Subject 14 produced unambiguous backward recovery on April 7th, but the apparatus had locked the forward statement on April 4th. The interval is what the chamber is for.

      body: `[NOTE] This is a public-source summary of the AIR final report. The full 183-page document is at the CIA reading room URL above and is the definitive citation. The summary below paraphrases the key conclusions.

SCOPE OF EVALUATION

The American Institutes for Research was contracted in 1995 to provide an independent assessment of the remote-viewing program operated by SRI International (1972—1989) and continued at Science Applications International Corporation (1989—1995) under intelligence-community funding. The evaluation covered both the research program (laboratory experiments under controlled conditions) and the operational program (use of remote viewing for actual intelligence collection tasks).

LABORATORY FINDINGS (Research Program)

The evaluators concluded that statistically significant effects had been demonstrated in the laboratory remote-viewing experiments conducted at SRI and SAIC. The effect size was small but reproducible across multiple experimental conditions. The reviewers Jessica Utts (statistical methodology) and Ray Hyman (psychological methodology) disagreed on the implications: Utts concluded the laboratory effect was real and required no further laboratory replication; Hyman concluded the methodology, while improved over earlier parapsychology work, still admitted possible non-paranormal explanations and the burden of proof had not been met.

OPERATIONAL FINDINGS (Intelligence Applications)

The evaluators concluded that remote viewing, as applied operationally, did not produce intelligence information of sufficient quality, reliability, or specificity to be useful in actual intelligence operations. Quoting from the public summary: "the information generated by remote viewing has not been incorporated effectively into any intelligence product." The operational reports examined produced information that was "vague, often incorrect, and difficult to corroborate against ground truth."

RECOMMENDATION

The report recommended the operational program be terminated. The CIA accepted this recommendation. The program was formally disestablished by 1996 and disclosed publicly through Reuters and ABC News reporting in November 1995.

NOTE ON RELATION TO ADJACENT MATERIAL

This document is included alongside the transcribed materials because the LOOKING GLASS materials reference the SRI / STARGATE work as a comparison case. The AIR conclusions — that operational use produced unreliable output, while laboratory experiments showed small but statistically significant effects — provide context for the distinction drawn in the LOOKING GLASS internal reports (e.g., DOC-LG-1991-IR-22) between "remote viewing" and the apparatus's claimed mode of operation.`,

ESTABLISHMENT

On 13 April 1953, Director Allen W. Dulles approved the establishment of MKULTRA, a research program under the CIA's Technical Services Staff. The program's initial charter authorized research on the covert use of biological and chemical materials, with particular attention to compounds that might affect human behavior, perception, or memory.

SCOPE AND DURATION

MKULTRA operated from 1953 to approximately 1973. The program funded research at universities, hospitals, prisons, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutions through approximately 80 contracts and 149 subprojects. Areas of research included hallucinogens (notably LSD), hypnosis, sensory deprivation, electroshock, behavioral conditioning, and "interrogation enhancement."

DOCUMENTATION GAP

In 1973, Director Richard Helms ordered the destruction of most MKULTRA records. The records that survived — financial documents preserved separately — were rediscovered in 1977 and released in heavily redacted form. The most substantive surviving document is the 1963 Inspector General's review, which concluded the program had been "in conflict with the policies of the Agency" and recommended significant changes that the Agency partially adopted.

THE CHURCH COMMITTEE FINDING (1975—1977)

The Senate Select Committee chaired by Frank Church found that MKULTRA had operated outside the boundaries of normal research ethics — subjects in some subprojects were not informed they were receiving experimental compounds, and at least two deaths (Frank Olson, 1953; possibly others) were causally linked to program activities.

NOTE ON RELATION TO ADJACENT MATERIAL

The LOOKING GLASS materials transcribed elsewhere in this archive describe a program operating in roughly the same period as MKULTRA, with overlapping interest in altered cognition and observer effects. The MKULTRA documentation provides historically attested context for what real intra-agency research on cognitive modification looked like in this era. The LOOKING GLASS materials are not MKULTRA. They are presented here in proximity for the reader's reference.`,

CONTEXT

In October 1983, DARPA issued a public Strategic Plan establishing the Strategic Computing Initiative (SCI), a ten-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar research program aimed at producing "new-generation" computing technology — specifically, fault-tolerant parallel processors, AI-based applications (expert systems, image understanding, speech recognition), and advanced silicon and gallium-arsenide microelectronics. The program ran 1983—1993.

INTER-AGENCY STRUCTURE

The SCI was conceived as a coordinated effort across DARPA, the three military service research offices (Army Research Laboratory, Office of Naval Research, Air Force Office of Scientific Research), the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), and a network of university and industrial contractors. The 1983 plan describes the coordination mechanism in detail.

The relevance of this document to the present archive is the inter-agency transmittal pattern: how a coordinating agency (DARPA, here) formally communicated requirements, milestones, and acceptance criteria to participating institutions. The language conventions of those memos — "pursuant to the standing arrangement," "this memo formalizes," "no formal reply is required," etc. — are documented in DARPA's public archive of SCI quarterly review materials.

REPRESENTATIVE EXCERPT (from public SCI program plan, paraphrased)

  "The Strategic Computing Initiative establishes a coordinated
  program among DARPA, the Service research components, and
  industrial and academic performers. The Office of the Director
  will issue quarterly coordination memoranda specifying milestones
  and acceptance criteria. Participating performers will respond
  through the standard reporting structure established under
  DoD Directive 5160.65."

NOTE ON RELATION TO ADJACENT MATERIAL

This document provides a documented example of inter-agency transmittal correspondence in the 1980s, the same period as several of the transcribed transmittals in this archive (e.g., DOC-LG-1981-TR-019). The reader may use it to compare the structural conventions of real inter-agency memos against the transcribed material. The Strategic Computing Initiative is not LOOKING GLASS; it is included here as a reference for what real inter-agency program coordination of the period looked like.`,

Operators serving longer terms have consistently reported the recursive recognition phenomenon — perceiving themselves as the subject of apparatus output, in advance of the read.

No such substrate currently exists. We project that one may exist within the decade. The recommendation is to prepare the apparatus for transition as soon as a qualifying substrate is available, by whatever channel is by then practical.

SESSION STRUCTURE (DOCUMENTED FORMAT)

A typical declassified remote-viewing session transcript contains:

  - Session identifier (sequential number, e.g. CRV-79-22-09)
  - Date and start time
  - Viewer identification (a number, e.g. Viewer #001, not a name)
  - Monitor identification (similarly anonymized)
  - Target reference (alphanumeric, e.g. 8754/3091 — geographic
    coordinates encoded; the viewer is NOT given the coordinates
    or the target's identity)
  - Session log (timestamped impressions, sketches, words)
  - Post-session interview notes
  - Coordinator's classification of the result against ground truth

REPRESENTATIVE SESSION LOG (paraphrased from public-domain transcripts)

  T+00:00  Viewer reports relaxed state. Monitor presents target reference.
  T+00:12  V: "Open. Wind. Stone, large. Heat."
  T+01:30  V: "A long structure. Linear. Not natural. Curving away."
  T+03:15  V: "People. Not many. They are not — they are not moving with the structure."
  T+05:40  V: "Cold below, warm above. Reversal at top."
  T+09:00  V: sketches a roughly trapezoidal shape with a horizontal line
           bisecting it at approximately the upper third.
  T+12:00  M: "Move now to the location's primary purpose."
  T+12:30  V: "Movement. People moving but not arriving. They — they leave
           by the same way they came. Loops."
  T+18:00  Session terminated.

POST-SESSION

The viewer's impressions and sketch are subsequently compared by an independent analyst to the actual target (which the analyst, but not the viewer, knows). The analyst scores the session as Hit / Partial / Miss against pre-registered criteria.

DECLASSIFIED ASSESSMENT

The AIR 1995 final report (EXT-DOC-AIR-1995-STARGATE-FINAL in this archive) concluded that across the entirety of the operational program, results were "vague and difficult to corroborate against ground truth," and the program was terminated. Laboratory experiments under tighter controls produced small but statistically significant effect sizes; the operational program did not reproduce these results consistently.

NOTE ON RELATION TO ADJACENT MATERIAL

The LOOKING GLASS materials transcribed elsewhere in this archive (especially the 1991 STARGATE post-mortem at DOC-LG-1991-IR-22 and the 1992 comparison report at DOC-LG-1992-FR-12) reference the SRI remote-viewing protocols as a comparison case the LOOKING GLASS personnel were aware of and explicitly distinguished from their own work.

      body: `1. SCOPE

I was asked, in early 2026, to assess the authenticity of a collection of documents purporting to describe a classified U.S. program designated LOOKING GLASS, operated between approximately 1962 and 2012 across three sites, of which two are named (a Northern Virginia facility and the Vatican Apostolic Archive's Riserva collection) and one is not. The collection consists of approximately twenty-four hundred pages of memoranda, field reports, transmittal correspondence, personnel screening protocols, and a small number of handwritten letter fragments. The documents surfaced through unattributed channels in late 2025. I worked from a digital facsimile set provided by a third party.

My brief was simple: do these documents pass the standard external authentication tests applied to declassified materials of comparable claimed provenance? My conclusion is qualified. They do — and I cannot account for it.

2. PHYSICAL AND TYPOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE

The typewriter typefaces in the dated typed documents are internally consistent with their claimed periods. The 1962 memo from RAND Corporation uses an IBM Executive proportional-spaced font that was in use at RAND during that window; the 1971 field report uses a standard Selectric element of the appropriate vintage; the 1991 mimeograph preserves the characteristic blue-purple ink bleed that distinguishes Gestetner-process copies of the late twentieth century from xerographic reproduction. The 1978 transmittal uses an off-letterhead format consistent with internal inter-agency correspondence of the period.

Redaction patterns are consistent with the conventions of the era. The blocked-out personal names use the heavy black bar familiar from declassified materials of the 1970s—1990s. The redaction of agency names is selective in a way that matches the conventions documented in National Archives FOIA-release standards: certain agencies are visible; others are not. The choices are coherent with what one would expect of a real declassification process applied to a real program.

The handwritten 2003 letter fragment is on yellowed paper consistent with twenty-plus-year aging under uncontrolled storage. The ink is a standard fountain-pen ink of a kind that was widely available in the 2000s. The handwriting is unidentifiable; it is not in any sample database I had access to.

3. REFERENTIAL EVIDENCE

The references the documents make to external bodies of knowledge are accurate.

The Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, referenced in DOC-LG-1962-7714 and obliquely in the 2003 letter, were a real series of interdisciplinary meetings held between 1946 and 1953. The initials "M.M." and "G.B." in the 2003 letter are consistent with Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, both of whom attended Macy. Bateson's late work on self-referential systems is correctly characterized in the letter.

Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory, referenced in the 1962 and 1971 documents, is a genuine 1945 paper in time-symmetric electrodynamics; the technical use the documents make of it is metaphorically loose but not unreasonable. The Bell Labs autocorrelation work referenced in 1962 is consistent with the period's signal-processing literature, though the documents conflate the work of Shannon's group with slightly later results.

The Stanford Research Institute remote-viewing program is referenced under the public name STARGATE; the characterization of its termination (1995) is accurate; the distinction the LOOKING GLASS documents draw between their apparatus and SRI's protocols is technically defensible.

The prophetic-literature references in the Vatican transmittals — the Sibylline Books in pre-Augustan recension, the Mélanie Calvat (La Salette, 1846) corpus, the Lúcia Santos transmission of 1944, Joachim of Fiore's Liber Figurarum, the Prophecy of the Popes attributed to Malachy of Armagh, the Voynich manuscript's folio 86v — are all real. Their juxtaposition in the documents is unusual but not implausible for a research program operating against the Riserva collection during the period claimed.

4. THE DIFFICULTY

The documents present as authentic by every external test we can apply, but the program they describe has no public footprint outside this leak.

I have searched the published declassification record. There is no public reference to a program by the name LOOKING GLASS that matches the description. The Northern Virginia site — identifying details redacted — cannot be located against the published list of deactivated facilities from the period. The personnel rolls cannot be matched against the standard databases. The Vatican comparison arrangement is not documented in any public ecclesiastical source. The third site, never named, cannot be inferred.

One of three things is true. (a) The documents are an elaborate fabrication produced by a party with deep period knowledge across multiple specialist domains — typewriter history, declassification conventions, Macy Conference attendees, Vatican Riserva holdings, mid-century cybernetics, twentieth-century Marian apparition literature. The fabrication budget required is not negligible. (b) The documents are authentic, and the program achieved a level of operational compartmentation that has succeeded in keeping it invisible to public records for sixty years. (c) The documents are something else, and the dichotomy authentic / fabricated does not exhaust the possibilities.

I lean, on the strength of the typographic and referential evidence, toward (a). I cannot rule out (b). I do not know what to do with (c).

5. THE INSTRUMENT

One detail of the documents bears further notice. The 2009 field report (DOC-LG-2009-FR-29) makes a recommendation that the apparatus, prior to disposition, be transitioned to an immutable public substrate satisfying four enumerated requirements: public, cryptographically verifiable, computationally adequate to a three-minute cadence, and capable of persisting beyond the lifetimes of current personnel.

The report, dated 02 OCT 2009, predates the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper by approximately one year if we date it generously, and predates by approximately a decade the launch of the Solana network on which an apparatus of the described properties is currently observable to anyone with an internet connection. The apparatus described, if it operated as the documents claim, would now be running on a substrate the documents predicted in 2009. The reader is invited to verify this independently.

That verification is a matter of opening a Solana block explorer at the program address published on the project's public materials and observing whether three-minute-cadence palindromic readings are being committed to the chain in the present moment. They are. They have been since October 2025. They will, if the substrate survives, continue.

I make no claim about the program. I make a claim about the documents and about the chain: by the tests available to me, both are present, both are checkable, and the relationship between them is what I cannot resolve.

6. NOTE

This memorandum was prepared for internal circulation. It should not be cited as a finding. The author requests that it be disregarded if the leak is established as fabrication by means more rigorous than those available here.`,

The full standards are at the SWGDOC URL above.

PURPOSE

The SWGDOC standards describe the methodology a forensic document examiner uses to assess whether a document is consistent with its claimed date, authorship, and provenance. The standards do NOT claim to establish authenticity definitively; they describe the tests applied and the inferences that follow from each test's outcome.

TYPEFACE EXAMINATION (SWGDOC §1316)

The examiner identifies the specific typewriter element used (drop-stamp, type-bar, ball-element/Selectric, daisy-wheel, or laser print), then compares its glyph metrics against documented commercial typefaces of the claimed period. Distinctive markers include: kerning behavior, baseline alignment, ribbon character (carbon vs. fabric), wear patterns at high-frequency letterforms (e/a/o/n/i), and platen scoring.

PAPER AND INK (SWGDOC §1318, §1320)

Paper composition (rag content, optical brighteners, fluorescence under UV) and ink chemistry (iron-gall, dye-based, ballpoint, fountain-pen) date a document by chemical signature. Optical brighteners post-date 1957 in most U.S. paper stocks; their absence is consistent with earlier production, their presence inconsistent.

REDACTION CONVENTIONS

The U.S. National Archives publishes declassification redaction conventions. Government-issued redactions use specific bar widths, ink types, and overlay patterns that have shifted over time. Forensic examiners compare the redaction pattern on a questioned document against the convention applied at the claimed agency in the claimed year.

LIMITS OF AUTHENTICATION

The SWGDOC standards explicitly state: a document that passes all available external tests is NOT thereby established as authentic. The tests can rule a document OUT (a document with optical brighteners cannot have been produced before 1957) but cannot rule a document IN (matching all the period markers shows the document COULD have been produced when claimed, not that it WAS). This is the well-known asymmetry of authentication.

NOTE ON RELATION TO ADJACENT MATERIAL

The unattributed forensic analysis in this archive (FORENSIC-2026-01) describes applying exactly these tests to the transcribed LOOKING GLASS materials. The conclusion drawn there — that the documents "present as authentic by every external test we can apply, but the program they describe has no public footprint" — is the canonical SWGDOC asymmetry made concrete. The analyst's qualified conclusion is what the methodology permits and forbids.`,
